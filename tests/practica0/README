This file will show you how to create a practice:


Files needed:

FileName.md - the file wit markdown content
pract.json - configuration to upload practice practice
conf.json - configuration file for build the source code
actions.js - functions in javascript


Directories needed:

./jade - here you can put the jade template (we give one by default but you can modify it)
./dust - dust templates for building practice
./content -  content like images used to put into practice


You have to use html comments to enclose the blocks into *.md file and some options that I will explain next.
